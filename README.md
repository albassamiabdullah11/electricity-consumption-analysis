#  Saudi Electricity Consumption Analysis

##  Overview
Comprehensive analysis of electricity consumption patterns in Saudi Arabia, exploring seasonal trends and temperature correlations.

##  Objectives
- Analyze electricity consumption patterns over 2 years
- Identify peak usage periods and seasonal variations
- Examine temperature-consumption relationship
- Provide actionable insights for energy planning

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Statistical Analysis**

##  Key Findings
1. **Peak Consumption**: Summer months (June-August) show highest consumption
2. **Temperature Correlation**: Strong positive correlation (0.85) between temperature and consumption
3. **Weekly Patterns**: Weekend consumption is 8% higher than weekdays
4. **Average Consumption**: 18,500 MW daily average

##  Visualizations
The project generates 4 comprehensive visualizations:
- Time series analysis of consumption patterns
- Monthly average consumption comparison
- Temperature vs consumption scatter plot with trend line
- Weekday vs weekend consumption analysis

##  How to Run

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Analysis
```bash
python electricity_analysis.py
```

### Output
The script generates:
- 4 PNG visualization files
- 1 CSV summary report
- Statistical analysis in console

##  Data Source
 **Note**: This project currently uses **synthetic data** generated for demonstration and learning purposes.

### Synthetic Data Generation
- Electricity consumption patterns simulated using NumPy
- Realistic seasonal and weekly variations applied
- Random noise added for authenticity

### Future Enhancements
In a production environment, this would be replaced with:
- Real data from Saudi Electricity Company (SEC)
- Public datasets from ECRA (Electricity & Cogeneration Regulatory Authority)
- Open data from government sources

##  Skills Demonstrated
Despite using synthetic data, this project demonstrates:
-  Data analysis workflows and methodologies
-  Statistical analysis and correlation studies
-  Professional data visualization
-  Python programming best practices
-  Understanding of domain-specific patterns
-  Clear documentation and reporting

##  Future Improvements
- [ ] Integrate real SEC data via API
- [ ] Implement predictive models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- [ ] Add regional analysis (Central, Eastern, Western)
- [ ] Create interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- [ ] Add forecasting capabilities
- [ ] Include cost analysis
